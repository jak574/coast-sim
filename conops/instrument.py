class Instrument(BaseModel):
    """
    A model representing a spacecraft instrument with power consumption characteristics.

    This class defines an instrument's basic properties including its name and power
    draw specifications. It provides methods to query power consumption in different
    operational modes.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the instrument. Defaults to "Default Instrument".
        power_draw (PowerDraw): The power draw characteristics of the instrument,
            including nominal power, peak power, and mode-specific power settings.
            Defaults to a PowerDraw with 50W nominal and 100W peak power.

    Methods:
        power(mode): Returns the power draw for the specified operational mode.

    Example:
        >>> instrument = Instrument(name="Camera", power_draw=PowerDraw(nominal_power=75))
        >>> instrument.power()
        75.0

    Attributes:

            a single default Instrument instance.

    Methods:
        power(mode): Calculate the total power consumption across all instruments.

    Example:
